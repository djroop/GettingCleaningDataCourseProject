# CodeBook

## This code is designed to extract a tidy dataset out of data collected from accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S phones worn on the
## waists of participants while doing certain activities.  A set of measurements was taken from each phone for each activity.
## This code extracts the average of each measurement for each activity and each participant.
## Brief summary of the raw data:
      -There are 30 participants numbered 1:30
      -There are 6 activities: {Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying}
      -There are 33 core meansurements taken from the smartphones:
       *Note: Each measurement followed by "-XYZ" is actually three measurements, one for each axis.

## Explanation of transformations:
 1. Data is downloaded
 2. Training and test datasets are combined into one data table(Variable "DT")
    This satisfies step 1 of the assignment instructions
 3. Features dataset is loaded and applied to the names vector of DT giving the variables descriptive names
    This satisfies step 4 of the assignment instructions
 4. Columns containing mean and stdev data for the measurements are extracted and stored in separate data table (Variable "DT2")
    This satisfies step 2 of the assignment instructions
 5. Subject and activity data are loaded, modified to have descriptive names and combined into two data tables (Variables "DTS" and "DTA")
    This satisfies step 3 of the assignment instructions
 6. Averages are taken by subject and by activity and results are combined into single dataset (Variable "DTT")
    This satisfies step 5 of the assignment instructions

## Variable Descriptions:
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and
tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then 
they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 
20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration 
signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using 
the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
