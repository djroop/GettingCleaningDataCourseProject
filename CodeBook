# CodeBook

## This code is designed to extract a tidy dataset out of data collected from accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S phones worn on the
## waists of participants while doing certain activities.  A set of measurements was taken from each phone for each activity.
## This code extracts the average of each measurement for each activity and each participant.
## Brief summary of the raw data:
      -There are 30 participants numbered 1:30
      -There are 6 activities: {Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying}
      -There are 33 core meansurements taken from the smartphones:
       *Note: Each measurement followed by "-XYZ" is actually three measurements, one for each axis.

## Explanation of transformations:
 1. Data is downloaded
 2. Training and test datasets are combined into one data table(Variable "DT")
    This satisfies step 1 of the assignment instructions
 3. Features dataset is loaded and applied to the names vector of DT giving the variables descriptive names
    This satisfies step 4 of the assignment instructions
 4. Columns containing mean and stdev data for the measurements are extracted and stored in separate data table (Variable "DT2")
    This satisfies step 2 of the assignment instructions
 5. Subject and activity data are loaded, modified to have descriptive names and combined into two data tables (Variables "DTS" and "DTA")
    This satisfies step 3 of the assignment instructions
 6. Averages are taken by subject and by activity and results are combined into single dataset (Variable "DTT")
    This satisfies step 5 of the assignment instructions
